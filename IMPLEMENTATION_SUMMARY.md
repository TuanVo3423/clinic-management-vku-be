## 💡 Usage Example

```javascript
// 1. Get available beds
GET /beds/available?appointmentDate=2025-10-15&appointmentStartTime=09:00&appointmentEndTime=11:00

// 2. Create appointment with bed
POST /appointments
{
  "patientId": "...",
  "bedId": "...",      // ← Bed ID from step 1
  "appointmentDate": "2025-10-15",
  "appointmentStartTime": "09:00",
  "appointmentEndTime": "11:00",
  ...
}

// 3. System automatically checks:
